# Spore Mod: Advanced Creature Paint

This mod lets you **paint your creatures like buildings**: paint each prat individually with hundreds of textures.

The creations made with this mod **can be shared** to the Sporepedia, but users that do not have the mod will not see the additional paints (they will see it like a regular creature).

To fully enjoy this mod, we recommend you also install the [color wheel mod](https://github.com/emd4600/EnhancedColorPickerMod#readme). If you already had it, use the link to update it, to ensure it is compatible with this new mod.

## Installation

This mod requires the Galactic Adventures and the [ModAPI Launcher Kit](https://davoonline.com/sporemodder/rob55rod/ModAPI/Public/).
1. If you don't have it yet, install the [ModAPI Launcher Kit](https://davoonline.com/sporemodder/rob55rod/ModAPI/Public/).
2. Download the `AdvancedCreaturePaint.sporemod` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/emd4600/advanced-creature-paint/releases/latest).
3. Execute the ![](https://sporemodder.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/easy-installer-icon-small.png?w=43&zoom=2) **Easy Installer**. It will show a file chooser dialog, find the `EnhancedColorPicker.sporemod` file you just downloaded.
4. Done!

Remember you have to use the `Spore ModAPI Launcher.exe` to launch the game, otherwise the mod will not show.

## About the mod

- To use the mod, go to paint mode in any creature editor, then use the *Paint Brush* category:

- Select the paint you want, choose the colors, and then click on any part to paint it.
- A Spore part is divided in 5 regions; **base**, **coat**, **detail**, **textured areas** (that usually don't change color, like the inside of a mouth), and **identity color** (used in tribal and civ parts). The mod lets you use a different paint for each of those 5 regions, using the buttons on the top of the paint page:

- You can paint several regions at once by `Ctrl + Click` on the buttons. Double click on any button to select them all, which will paint the entire part with the same paint.
- You can remove the special paint of a specific part region by clicking on the `Remove paint` button on the left, and then clicking on the part.
- Tip: you can paint parts even when the creature is still loading its paint. This allows you to quickly paint many parts without having to wait.

## Known issues
- The mod is not compatible with DarkInjection's Full UI (user interface). You can use any other Dark Injection UI.
